    <b> A little about myself : </b><br>
    Since I was very young , I messed a lot with computers, since win95, xp and so on. Pressed every key combination on the keyboard in various places to discover all of the shortcuts (before I knew how to google).<br>
    Started to code (in java) when I was 14 (public school in the US), since then had my official training in <b>8200</b> but most of the things I gathered where <b>self taught</b>.
    <b>SigmaLabs</b> and <b>TechStars Alumni</b>
    <br><br>
    <b> Tools I've Picked Up on the Way :</b><br>
    Today I design and write code for either work or fun, I always have at least one project going on so my toolbelt is always growing...
    <b> For backend</b> I usually use <b>python</b> (cause i love it), with <b>Flask</b> for <b>web apps</b>, but  also use <b>node</b> when needed.<b> For frontend</b> I'll either go with <b>Vue.js</b> (for dynamic) or <b>Jekyll</b> (for static) usually with <b>Tailwind CSS</b>
    In the past I've written various <b>systems & applications for web, pc, android (java/kotlin), ios &watch (swift)</b>
    Depending on the app/system will host on <b>vps</b> or on some <b>cloud</b> or <b>serverless</b> (such as <b>Heroku</b> or <b>Vercel</b>)<br>
    Also recently got into doing magic with <b>whatssapp</b> automation.
    <br><br>
    <b> Currently looking For :</b><br>
    Currently a freelancer and open to work opportunities, but would like to find a good company that I can grow in and be surrounded by cool and professional people that I can learn from.<br>
    A classic job role for me will be <b>senior python developer</b><br>
    Will be most beneficial in complex micro service system architectures<br>
    Willing to learn any new language or stack when needed
    <br><br>
    <b> In General : </b><br>
    I'm <b>good at research</b> and <b>learning new skills</b>, especially if it's useful, or is needed to solve my tasks. Usually I'm the most senior developer around but I'd <b>love to find an environment where I can be around and learn from great minded people.</b>
    ðŸ’œðŸ¦„
    <br><br>
    <b>Todo :</b><br>
    <b>-</b> add links to projects from past year<br>
    <b>-</b> update Experience, Upcoming and Languages<br>
